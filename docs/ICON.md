# App Icon Design

## Concept

The icon represents a reliable bridge between Slack conversations and a local Claude execution engine:

- **Two overlapping chat bubbles** express message flow and collaboration.
- **Interlocking chain arcs** symbolize a connector/broker role.
- **Neon blue + green on deep indigo** communicates developer tooling and real-time automation.
- **Rounded square container** aligns with modern macOS icon visual language.

## Asset location

All icon files are committed in:

- `Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`

with standard macOS sizes from 16x16 to 1024x1024.

## Generation

Icon assets are generated by:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_app_icon.py
```

The script renders a 1024x1024 master image and downscales it to all required app icon variants.

## Why generated assets

Using a generation script makes icon evolution reproducible:

- easy color or geometry adjustments
- deterministic output for CI/release
- avoids manual export drift across icon sizes
